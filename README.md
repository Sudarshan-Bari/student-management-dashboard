- ✅ Real-time form validation
- ✅ Loading states and error handling
- ✅ Responsive design (mobile, tablet, desktop)
- ✅ TypeScript for type safety
- ✅ localStorage persistence
- ✅ Accessible UI components

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

- **Framework**: Next.js 14 with App Router
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS v4
- **UI Components**: shadcn/ui
- **Icons**: Lucide React
- **State Management**: React hooks (useState, useEffect, useMemo)

## 📋 Key Learning Concepts

### 1. Async/await and Promises
\`\`\`javascript
// Mock API with realistic async behavior
const fetchCourses = async () => {
  try {
    setLoading(true)
    const coursesData = await mockCoursesAPI.getCourses()
    setCourses(coursesData)
  } catch (err) {
    setError("Failed to load courses")
  } finally {
    setLoading(false)
  }
}
\`\`\`

### 2. Event Loop Understanding
The project includes a demonstration function showing JavaScript's event loop behavior with synchronous code, setTimeout, and Promise microtasks.

### 3. React Hooks Mastery
- **useState**: Managing component state
- **useEffect**: Handling side effects and lifecycle
- **useMemo**: Performance optimization for expensive calculations

### 4. Form Validation
Comprehensive validation including:
- Required field validation
- Email format validation with regex
- Real-time error feedback
- Controlled component patterns

## 🎨 Design Principles

### Responsive Design
- Mobile-first approach
- Flexible grid layouts
- Touch-friendly interactions
- Optimized for all screen sizes

### User Experience
- Loading states for async operations
- Error handling with user-friendly messages
- Immediate feedback on form interactions
- Accessible design with proper ARIA labels

### Code Quality
- TypeScript for type safety
- Comprehensive comments explaining concepts
- Clean component architecture
- Separation of concerns
